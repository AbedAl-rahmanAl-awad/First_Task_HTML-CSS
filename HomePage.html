            Jordan, an Arab nation on the east bank of the Jordan River,
            is defined by ancient monuments, nature reserves and seaside resorts.
            Its home to the famed archaeological site of Petra, the Nabatean capital dating to around 300 B.C. Set in a
            narrow valley with tombs,
            temples and monuments carved into the surrounding pink sandstone cliffs,
            Petra earns its nickname, the "Rose City."

                <p class="About">Originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō is a historic and
                    archaeological city in
                    southern Jordan.
                    It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming
                    the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
                    The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might
                    have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century
                    BC.
                    Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second
                    century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.
                    The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes
                    by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
                    The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of
                    their wealth.
                    The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies,
                    and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain.
                    They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving.
                    Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure believed to be
                    the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV was constructed,
                    and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.

            <p class="Name">Jerash</p>
            <p class="About"> is a city in northern Jordan. The city is the administrative center of the Jerash
                Governorate,
                and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015. It is located 48 kilometres (30 mi) north of the capital city
                Amman.
                The earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan,
                where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered.
                Jerash flourished during the Greco and Roman periods until the mid-eighth century CE,
                when the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it,
                while subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction. However,
                in the year 1120, Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men to build up
                a fort in an unknown site of the ruins of the ancient city,
                likely the highest spot of the city walls in the north-eastern hills. It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin
                II, King of Jerusalem, and utterly destroyed.
                Then the Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib (Seecip).
                Jerash was then deserted until it reappeared by the beginning of the Ottoman rule in the early 16th
                century.
                In the census of 1596, it had a population of 12 Muslim households. However,
                archaeologists found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was
                resettled before the Ottoman era.
                The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries
                have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery.
                The ancient city has been gradually revealed through a series of excavations which commenced in 1925,
                and continue to this day.

                Umm Qais is located 28 km north of Irbid and 120 km north of Amman. It expanded from the ruins of
                ancient Gadara,
                which are located on a ridge 378 metres (1,240 ft) above sea level, overlooking the Sea of Tiberias, the
                Golan Heights, and the Yarmouk River gorge.
                Strategically central and located close to multiple water sources, Umm Qais has historically attracted a
                high level of interest.

            <p class="Name">Aqaba</p>
            <p class="About"> is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of
                Aqaba.
                Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative centre of the Aqaba Governorate.
                The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi).
                Today, Aqaba plays a major role in the development of the Jordanian economy, through the vibrant trade
                and tourism sectors. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.
                Aqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and
                Africa,
                has made its port important over the course of thousands of years.
                The ancient city was called Elath, adopted in Latin as Aela and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic
                location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the
                Chalcolithic period.
                Aela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic
                conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval.
                The Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba, depicted in the film Lawrence of Arabia,
                resulted in victory for Arab forces over the Ottoman defenders.
                Aqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has placed it in Jordan's golden triangle of tourism,
                which strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions
                in Jordan.
